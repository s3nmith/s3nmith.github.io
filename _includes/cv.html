          Hallo! I'm currently studying Computer Science and Communications
          Engineering at Waseda University, aiming to finish by 2026. It's been
          quite a journey since school in four different countries! Recently,
          I'm pretty active in our Google Developers Student Club, where I use
          the skills I learned into practice.

          On the job side of things, I've been busy with some awesome projects
          and internships. Like at Stevin Rock, I dove into data analysis, which
          was all about uncovering neat insights from big data for the world's
          largest limestone quarry. During university, our team landed in the in
          the Global Top 100 for the Google Solutions Challenge, by creating an
          iOS app for sorting garbage and we are continuing development of that
          project!
